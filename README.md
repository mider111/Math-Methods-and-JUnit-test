# Math-Methods-and-JUnit-test
Specifically, implementation of the following methods from the Math class without calling any of the methods from the Math class: 
1. abs() for integer values 
2. max() for integer values 
3. double pow(double base, int exponent) 
4. min() for integer values 
There is also a JUnit test class for this program. Specifically, a small set of tests that represent distinct groups of inputs.
